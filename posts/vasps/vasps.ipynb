As a blockchain data analyst, it is essential to recognize this distinction to avoid misleading assumptions. Genuine regulatory compliance goes beyond registration, encompassing robust frameworks that ensure adherence to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, as well as effective risk management practices."
