<p>Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you were repeatedly told that your decision was wrong? That was precisely my experience when I chose to pause my enrollment in a Ph.D.&nbsp;program to embark on a new adventure, exploring different aspects of my life.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-search-of-meaning-from-undergrad-to-masters-and-beyond">ü§î In Search of Meaning: From Undergrad to Master‚Äôs, and Beyond</h3>
<p>When I completed my undergraduate degree, I had grand plans. However, I soon discovered that the majority of my daily duties at work were repetitive tasks, devoid of any opportunity to devise innovative solutions to real-world challenges. This was far from the kind of work I had envisioned doing for the rest of my life. I started to believe that perhaps an undergraduate degree wasn‚Äôt sufficient, prompting me to pursue a master‚Äôs degree with the intention of enhancing my skill set. Despite the effort and time I dedicated to obtaining my second degree, I remained dissatisfied with the nature of the problems I was able to solve with my newly acquired skills.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="self-reflection-and-discovery-the-journey-beyond-academia">üòü Self-Reflection and Discovery: The Journey Beyond Academia</h3>
<p>Fast forward nine years, and I‚Äôve completed my bachelor‚Äôs degree in accounting and finance as well as my master‚Äôs degree in public administration. Standing in a foreign country with my certificate in hand, I had no idea what the future held for me. I began to question the decisions I‚Äôd made in my life. Had I made the right choices? Was it even a good idea to leave my country to study abroad? I felt a gaping void in my life. I vividly remember the day I received my certificate, thinking to myself, ‚ÄòAfter all this toil and suffering, this is what I get? A piece of paper üòÅ!!‚Äô</p>
<p>To be fair, I genuinely enjoyed my time as a master‚Äôs student, but deep down, I felt I had no life-changing contributions to offer in solving some of the world‚Äôs most challenging problems. I was eager to make a significant change. The logical next step was to enroll in a Ph.D.&nbsp;program. However, I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of rushing into a Ph.D.&nbsp;without first discovering who I truly was. So, I decided to take a break from academics to find myself. I wanted to understand more about my values and what truly mattered in my life. This wasn‚Äôt an easy decision, especially as almost all my friends were enrolling in Ph.D.&nbsp;programs.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="awakening-from-the-loop-my-pivotal-turn-towards-purpose">Awakening from the Loop: My Pivotal Turn Towards Purpose</h3>
<p>Reflecting on my educational journey ‚Äì bouncing through schools, searching for a purpose, making what I thought were all the right choices, experiencing sleepless nights and handing in dozens of assignments, not to mention the countless all-nighters spent preparing for exams ‚Äì it hit me hard. I was simply caught in the loop of life. I was living a pre-designed existence, a path that many people follow: go to school, get a job, settle down. It dawned on me that to break this cycle, I needed to change. This was the turning point in my life, the pivotal moment when I committed to dedicating the rest of my existence to pursuing the deep-seated intuition of my true life‚Äôs purpose, which I had consciously ignored for over a decade. I was now ready to take life head-on üí™.</p>

<section id="the-new-path" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-new-path">The New Path‚Ä¶</h3>
<p>I began to take inventory of my interests and the things that captivated me most in life. Furthermore, I dove into researching key global problems and innovative solutions to address them. At this time, I was merely following my intuition. I didn‚Äôt have a plan - just a burning desire to succeed.</p>
<p>The last time I felt this way was during a business idea competition where I had the opportunity to apply my creative skills to solve real-world challenges. I cannot learn by rote; I‚Äôm a visual learner who thrives on hands-on experience and conducting my own experiments, keeping the bigger picture in mind. This approach was not accommodated by the rigorous education I received during my bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees.</p>
<p>For several months, I dabbled in web development and data science. I still vividly recall the first time I got my own computer. I would sit behind it, imagining myself as a hacker infiltrating someone else‚Äôs system. Strangely enough, it felt exhilarating. I yearned to create something, but my life‚Äôs realities and my parents‚Äô emphasis on education didn‚Äôt allow me the time to follow that intuition. Academic work was paramount to me then; it seemed like the logical path.</p>
<p>Eventually, I discovered the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and it astounded me. I read about the crucial problems these technologies are solving and how they are transforming the world, especially in developing regions. That‚Äôs when I decided that this is the path I wanted to commit my life to üíØ. It‚Äôs an incredibly exciting field!</p>
<p>I‚Äôm still learning and discovering new learning styles. Additionally, I‚Äôm experimenting with different technologies and creating amazing products along the way.</p>
<p>In my upcoming posts, I‚Äôll share about my journey into deep learning, and the interesting projects I‚Äôm working on. If you‚Äôre a machine learning enthusiast, researcher, or practitioner, feel free to reach out so we can learn and collaborate.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm thrilled to share my stories, and I hope they can shift your perspective about your life and what truly matters to you. I‚Äôd like to conclude with a thought-provoking quote by Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>I am very glad to share my stories and hope it can change your perspective about your life and what matters most to you. I will like to end with a thought-provoking quote by Steve Jobs.</p>
